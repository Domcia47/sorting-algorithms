Three implementations of soritng alghoritms, which counts the time of sorting.
Times where used to calculate time complexity and creating plots.

plots.pdf contains plots created in Python to comapre exeprimental complexity to theoretical complexity.
There are plots created based on formulas and based on measured time on every picture.
